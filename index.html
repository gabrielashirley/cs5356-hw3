        <!-- I used the mix-blend-mode and transition CSS properties to add creative visual effects by specifying how an element's content should blend with its background. I used luminosity blending mode which creates a monochrome effect by combining the luminosity of the element with the hue and saturation of the background. One interesting aspect is that the effect is applied in real-time, allowing for dynamic changes based on user interaction. By combining it with the transition property, it creates smooth animations between different blend modes. I also learned that it needs contrasting colors to show its effect. So initially it did not work when my background is white, so I changed it to light-grey to see the effect. -->

          Hello, my name is Gabriela Shirley! I'm currently pursuing a Master of
          Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell Tech, set to graduate in
          May 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am driven to expand my horizons in various fields and aspire to use
          my accumulated knowledge to make an impact on my community and the
          world at large. My focus is on Computer Science, specifically
          Web/Software Engineering, but I'm also studying design and human
          cognition. This interdisciplinary approach allows me to combine both
          my technical and personal skills to create innovative applications
          that will ultimately help others. As a woman in tech, I'm passionate
          about being an agent of change through my work in the field. I'm eager
          to get hands-on experience with websites, applications, and everything
          in between. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
          Please feel free to reach out to me for any inquiries! (◔ᴥ◔)

    <!-- I used the <details> element to create expandable/collapsible content sections without requiring JavaScript. It consists of a <summary> element, which acts as the visible header for the widget, and the rest of the content which is initially hidden. When the user clicks on the summary, the content toggles between visible and hidden states. This creates an intuitive way to organize and present information that benefits from a compact initial view with the option to expand for more details. I applied this to display my work experience given the title, company, and dates as the summary and my responsibilities in bullet points as the expandable details. -->
