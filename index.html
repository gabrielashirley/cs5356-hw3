        <p>
          Hello, my name is Gabriela Shirley! I'm currently pursuing a Master of
          Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell Tech, set to graduate in
          May 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am driven to expand my horizons in various fields and aspire to use
          my accumulated knowledge to make an impact on my community and the
          world at large. My focus is on Computer Science, specifically
          Web/Software Engineering, but I'm also studying design and human
          cognition. This interdisciplinary approach allows me to combine both
          my technical and personal skills to create innovative applications
          that will ultimately help others. As a woman in tech, I'm passionate
          about being an agent of change through my work in the field. I'm eager
          to get hands-on experience with websites, applications, and everything
          in between. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
          Please feel free to reach out to me for any inquiries! (◔ᴥ◔)
